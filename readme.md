# Temporal afforestation and deforestation geo change detection in satellite images
## About <a name = "about"></a>

We aim to develop an algorithm that shows the percentage change of forest cover in terms of afforestation and deforestation over any two given periods of time over a specified area. (Python, Next JS, OpenCV, image processing, machine learning)

Frontend Web app made with NextJS framework and backend with python.

Used KMeans, PCA, OpenCV to extract features display them.
